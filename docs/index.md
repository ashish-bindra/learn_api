# API

Aplication programing Interface is a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another.

- APIs are used to define the methods for communication between software components

## Brusup

You send a request to a server, and it send back a response. but APIs can do much more than that. THey can be used to create new APIs, to modify exisitng APIs and to integrate APis with other APIs.Most of the time that you practice is just `data picking` from APIs or `loop`through the data. But APIs can do much more than that.At a max level, you went through the basic of sate menagment.

> Beyond random user and github API

### step 1: http methods

Master the HTTP method. You should know the difference between GET,PUT,POST,PATCh,DELETE and OPTIONS.

- You SHould know when to use each method and what each method does.
- you should also know how to use thrse method in yur code

> GO to FreeAPi Kiten sink and learn to handel all http methods.Try them with different tools  like fetch, postman,axios,etc.

### step2: Status code and request handers

- You should know what status codes are and what they mean.
- you should know to handel different status codes un your code.
- You should also know how to request headers.
- you should also know what headers are and what they do.
-Know how to set headers in your code.
- learn things like
  - request header
  - request ip
  - request user agent
  - path variable
  - query parameters

### Step 3: Response handling

You should know how to handle respinses.

- do you how to handle different types of responses?
- You should know how to handle JSON,XML and other types of responses.
- You should know how to handle different types of error.
you should know how to handle diferent types of responses un your code like

---

- responses headers
- response caching
- response compression (gzip, brotli, etc)
- response cookies
- redirect handling
- Handling Images: Manage image responses in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

### Step 4: Authentication

You should know how to authenticate with APIs. You should know different types of authencation methods.

- You should know how to authentication in your code. Learn things like

- Baic authtication
- Beare token
- OAuth
- JWT
- API keys
- cookies
- session
- token
- refresh token

> You should need to learn about mobile authentication and Api handling different from web.
> THis is completely a bous step.

### step 5: API Rate Linmiting (Optional)

You should know how to rate limit APIs.

- You should know how too handle in ypur code. You should know hw to handle rate limiting in your Api like
- Rate limiting
- Throttling
- Caching
- Retry
- Circuit breaker
- Backoff
- Timeout
- Error handling

### step 6: Bonous learning

You are done btnow/

- Webhooks
- websockets
- GraphQl
- gRPC
- Rest
- SOAP

### Tools to handle APIS

- Axios
- Fetch
- Postman
- React Query
